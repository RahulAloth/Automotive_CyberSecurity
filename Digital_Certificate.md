### How Digital Certificates are Generated
The process of generating a digital certificate involves several entities and steps:

1. **Generate a Key Pair**: The applicant generates a public and private key pair using tools like OpenSSL or other cryptographic libraries.
2. **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**: The applicant creates a CSR, which includes the public key and other identifying information, and signs it with their private key.
3. **Registration Authority (RA)**: The RA verifies the applicant's identity and the information provided in the CSR.
4. **Certificate Authority (CA)**: The CA reviews the verified information from the RA and signs the CSR, creating the digital certificate.
5. **Issue the Certificate**: The CA issues the signed digital certificate to the applicant, who can then use it for secure communications.

### Structure of a Digital Certificate
A digital certificate typically includes the following components:

- **Version**: Indicates the version of the X.509 standard used.
- **Serial Number**: A unique identifier for the certificate.
- **Signature Algorithm**: The algorithm used by the CA to sign the certificate.
- **Issuer**: The CA that issued the certificate.
- **Validity Period**: The start and end dates during which the certificate is valid.
- **Subject**: The entity to whom the certificate is issued.
- **Subject Public Key Info**: The public key and the algorithm used.
- **Extensions**: Additional information such as key usage, certificate policies, and subject alternative names.
- **Signature**: The CA's digital signature that verifies the certificate's authenticity.
