# Automotive Security

At first, we have to understand the difference between safety and security. In the automotive industry, 
safety and security are two distinct but equally important concepts. Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

## Safety
- **Definition**: Safety refers to measures taken to prevent accidents and minimize the risk of injury or death.
- **Focus**: Protecting the physical well-being of the driver, passengers, and other road users.

- **Examples**:
  - **Active Safety**: Systems that help avoid accidents, such as anti-lock braking systems (ABS), electronic
    stability control, and collision warning systems.
  - **Passive Safety**: Features that protect occupants during an accident, like seat belts, airbags, and crumple zones.

## Security
- **Definition**: Security involves protecting the vehicle and its systems from intentional harm, theft, or unauthorized access.
- **Focus**: Safeguarding the vehicle's data and electronic systems from malicious attacks.
- **Examples**:
  - **Cybersecurity**: Measures to prevent hacking and unauthorized access to vehicle systems.
  - **Physical Security**: Features like alarms, immobilizers, and remote keyless entry systems.

## Key Differences
- **Objective**: Safety aims to prevent accidents and injuries, while security focuses on protecting against intentional threats and unauthorized access.
- **Approach**: Safety measures are often built into the vehicle's design and operation, whereas security measures involve both physical and digital protections.

Both safety and security are essential for modern vehicles, especially with the increasing complexity and
connectivity of automotive systems. Ensuring high levels of both can help protect against a wide range of risks.

# Automotive Security

Automotive mainly uses AutoSAR architecture for the ECU development. AutoSAR stack utilizes AutoSAR Diagnostics stack to enable security.
The automotive diagnostics stack is a collection of software components and protocols designed to facilitate the diagnosis and management of 
faults in vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). Here’s a brief overview:

## Key Components

### Diagnostic Communication Manager (DCM)
- **Communication Protocols**: Implements diagnostic protocols like UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) and OBD (On-Board Diagnostics).
- **Service Handling**: Manages diagnostic requests and responses, including reading diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs), ECU reset, and more.

### Diagnostic Event Manager (DEM)
- **Event Management**: Handles diagnostic events, including detection, storage, and aging of faults.
- **Fault Memory**: Stores DTCs and related data.
- **Event Debouncing**: Ensures stability by filtering transient faults.

### Fault Injection Manager (FIM)
- **Fault Simulation**: Allows testing of diagnostic systems by simulating faults.
- **Monitoring**: Tracks the behavior of the system under fault conditions.

## Protocols Supported
- **UDS (ISO 14229-1)**: Provides a comprehensive set of diagnostic services for vehicle ECUs.
- **OBD (On-Board Diagnostics)**: Focuses on emissions-related diagnostics and monitoring.

## Benefits
- **Standardization**: Ensures interoperability between different ECUs and diagnostic tools.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the diagnostic process, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.
- **Scalability**: Supports both classic and adaptive AUTOSAR platforms, catering to various vehicle architectures.

## Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS)
Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) is a standardized diagnostic communication protocol used in automotive electronic control units (ECUs). 
It is specified in the ISO 14229-1 standard and is widely adopted across the automotive industry. Here’s a detailed explanation:

### Overview
UDS enables diagnostic tools to communicate with vehicle ECUs, allowing for various diagnostic and maintenance tasks. 
It is based on the ISO-TP transport layer (ISO 15765-2) and utilizes the fifth (session) and seventh (application) layers of the OSI model.

### Key Features

#### Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs)
- **Reading and Clearing**: UDS allows for reading and clearing DTCs stored in the ECU, helping identify and resolve issues.

#### Parameter Extraction
- **Data Values**: Extracts important values like engine coolant temperature, state of charge (SoC), and vehicle identification number (VIN).

#### ECU Control
- **Firmware Updates**: Enables firmware flashing and updates to the ECU.
- **Behavior Modification**: Allows for resetting the ECU and modifying its behavior.

#### Security Access
- **Seed-Key Algorithm**: Uses security algorithms to unlock access to various ECU parameters.

### Diagnostic Services
UDS provides a range of diagnostic services, each identified by a unique Service Identifier (SID). Some of the key services include:
- **Diagnostic Session Control (0x10)**: Switches between different diagnostic sessions, each offering varying levels of access.
- **Read Data by Identifier (0x22)**: Retrieves specific data from the ECU.
- **Security Access (0x27)**: Manages security access to protected ECU functions.
- **Routine Control (0x31)**: Executes specific routines for testing and diagnostics.

### Practical Applications
- **Troubleshooting**: Helps in identifying and resolving vehicle issues by reading and clearing DTCs.
- **Maintenance**: Facilitates routine maintenance tasks like firmware updates and parameter adjustments.
- **Testing**: Allows for testing safety-critical features and modifying ECU settings.

### Benefits
- **Standardization**: Ensures interoperability across different manufacturers and diagnostic tools.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the diagnostic process, making it easier to manage vehicle systems.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various communication protocols, including CAN, KWP 2000, Ethernet, and LIN.

## For example, consider debug port protection using automotive cybersecurity, which of course utilizes the UDS protocol in detail.

## Debug Port Protection with UDS
Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) can be used to enhance the security of the debug port in automotive ECUs. Here’s how it works:

### Security Access Service (0x27)
- **Authentication**: UDS uses the Security Access service to authenticate users attempting to access the debug port.
   This involves a challenge-response mechanism where the ECU sends a "seed" and expects a "key" in return.
   The key is generated using a specific algorithm that only authorized users know.
- **Unlocking**: If the correct key is provided, the debug port is unlocked, allowing access to debugging functions.

### Locking Mechanism
- **Automatic Locking**: The debug port can be automatically locked after a certain number of failed authentication attempts.
   This prevents brute-force attacks.
- **Session Control**: UDS can switch between different diagnostic sessions, each with varying levels of access.
  Higher security levels require successful authentication to access sensitive functions.

### Configuration and Management
- **Password Protection**: The debug port can be protected with passwords stored in specific memory areas (e.g., UCB_DBG).
   These passwords are required to unlock the debug port.
- **Flash Read Protection**: Enabling flash read protection can also secure the debug port by preventing unauthorized access to the ECU’s memory.

### Practical Example
- **Infineon AURIX™ Microcontrollers**: These microcontrollers use UDS for debug port protection. The debug port is secured using passwords,
  and access is controlled through the Security Access service. If the correct password is not provided, the debug port remains locked.

### Benefits
- **Enhanced Security**: Protects against unauthorized access and potential tampering with the ECU.
- **Controlled Access**: Ensures that only authorized personnel can perform debugging and maintenance tasks.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for different levels of access based on the security requirements of the application.

Using UDS for debug port protection is a robust method to ensure the security and integrity of automotive ECUs.
