# Automotive Security

At first, we have to understand the difference between safety and security. In the automotive industry, 
safety and security are two distinct but equally important concepts. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of their differences:

## Safety
- **Definition**: Safety refers to measures taken to prevent accidents and minimize the risk of injury or death.
- **Focus**: Protecting the physical well-being of the driver, passengers, and other road users.

- **Examples**:
  - **Active Safety**: Systems that help avoid accidents, such as anti-lock braking systems (ABS), electronic
    stability control, and collision warning systems.
  - **Passive Safety**: Features that protect occupants during an accident, like seat belts, airbags, and crumple zones.

## Security
- **Definition**: Security involves protecting the vehicle and its systems from intentional harm, theft, or unauthorized access.
- **Focus**: Safeguarding the vehicle's data and electronic systems from malicious attacks.
- **Examples**:
  - **Cybersecurity**: Measures to prevent hacking and unauthorized access to vehicle systems.
  - **Physical Security**: Features like alarms, immobilizers, and remote keyless entry systems.

## Key Differences
- **Objective**: Safety aims to prevent accidents and injuries, while security focuses on protecting against intentional threats and unauthorized access.
- **Approach**: Safety measures are often built into the vehicle's design and operation, whereas security measures involve both physical and digital protections.

Both safety and security are essential for modern vehicles, especially with the increasing complexity and
connectivity of automotive systems. Ensuring high levels of both can help protect against a wide range of risks.
