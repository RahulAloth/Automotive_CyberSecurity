# Cryptography

Cryptography is the science of securing communication and information through mathematical techniques. 
The foundations of cryptography involve several key concepts and tools:

### Key Concepts
- **Encryption Schemes**: Methods to convert plaintext into ciphertext, making it unreadable without a decryption key.
- **Pseudorandom Generators**: Algorithms that produce sequences of numbers that appear random but are generated deterministically.
- **Digital Signatures**: Techniques to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message, software, or digital document.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Methods by which one party can prove to another that they know a value without revealing the value itself.
- **One-Way Functions**: Functions that are easy to compute in one direction but difficult to reverse, crucial for cryptographic security.

### Common Encryption Algorithms
Common encryption algorithms are essential for securing data and communications. Here are some widely used encryption algorithms:

#### Symmetric Encryption Algorithms
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Widely used for securing sensitive data. It supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: An older algorithm that has largely been replaced by AES due to its shorter key length of 56 bits.
- **3DES (Triple DES)**: An enhancement of DES that applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block.

#### Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms
- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: Commonly used for secure data transmission. It relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers.
- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**: Provides similar security to RSA but with smaller key sizes, making it more efficient.

#### Hashing Algorithms
- **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)**: Part of the SHA-2 family, widely used for data integrity and digital signatures.
- **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**: An older hashing algorithm that is now considered insecure for most applications.
