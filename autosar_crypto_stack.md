# Real Core (Core 0)

The term "real core" typically refers to the main processing unit of a system, such as the CPU (Central Processing Unit) or MCU (Microcontroller Unit). This core handles the primary computational tasks and runs the main application code. It is responsible for executing instructions, managing system resources, and performing general-purpose processing.

Core 0 typically refers to the primary processing core in a multi-core system. It handles general-purpose tasks and runs the main application code. In embedded systems, Core 0 is often responsible for managing system resources, executing instructions, and performing computational tasks.

# HSM Core

Hardware Security Module (HSM) core is a specialized component designed to enhance security within a system. It performs security-critical tasks such as encryption, decryption, key management, and secure boot processes. HSM cores are often used in embedded systems, automotive applications, and other environments where robust security is essential.

Key features of HSM cores include:

HSM cores help protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access or manipulation, making them vital for maintaining system integrity and security.

# Interaction Between Core 0 and HSM Core

In systems where both Core 0 and HSM core are present, they often need to communicate and coordinate their tasks. Here are some key points about their interaction:
