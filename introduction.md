**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and 
programs from digital attacks. These attacks are often aimed at accessing, 
changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes.

### Key Components of Cybersecurity
- **Network Security**: Protects the integrity and usability of network and data.
- **Application Security**: Focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats.
- **Information Security**: Protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.
- **Operational Security**: Includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets.
- **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity**: Defines how an organization responds to a 
cybersecurity incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data.
- **End-User Education**: Involves teaching users to follow best practices, such 
as not clicking on unknown links or downloading suspicious attachments.

### Why Cybersecurity is Important
Cybersecurity is crucial because it helps protect against the growing number of 
cyber threats that can lead to identity theft, financial loss, data breaches, and disruption of services. 
Effective cybersecurity measures are essential for maintaining the trust and safety of individuals and organizations.
